            an unknown burrow: a solitary sound nourishes the silent air. What can be heard are the drums and bass \
            that is L-Mac. Luke started DJing when he was 18 along with his home friends. He got involved with the \
            society through attending open decs sessions in 2020. His passion to grow an expressive underground \
            scene in Durham and support those DJs in a similar pursuit led him to apply for an executive position. \
            He employs his whacky personality and unique energy to the role of social secretary. He believes DJs \
            are at their best when given the opportunity to socialise and bond amongst one another. Featuring at \
            Fabs, Fractal, college events, house parties, fashion shows and balls, Luke\'s career so far so been \
            somewhat diversified. It has helped him gain universal multi-genre experience and built his ability to \
            bond with varying crowds - it was tested last year at socially distanced events.  Every set he plans he \
            aims to please the client yet offer them a taster of something different. Whether that be a unique pop \
            remix, jazzy drums or classically composed techno - you can never be quite sure what L-Mac will pull \
            out from his sleeveâ€¦',

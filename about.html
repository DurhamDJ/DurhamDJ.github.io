                        <p>I joined DDJS in the first year of my degree, and it has since become a huge
                            part of my uni experience. Through the open decks, I have met some amazing people,
                            enhanced my DJ’ing expertise, and had the chance to perform in multiple events (as
                            Jakeverse). Seeing how beneficial it has been for me and others, I took on the role
                            of president to ensure new members also get this opportunity. Music is my passion and
                            I have the drive to dedicate a lot of my time and energy to DDJS.</p>

                        <p>DDJS was a big part of my first year and through it I met some great people with
                            a passion for the art of electronic music. Because of the opportunities the society
                            gave me, I wanted to be in a position where I could do the same for others. My main
                            goal is to introduce people, both those who have DJed before and those who haven't,
                            to the appreciation of vinyl and mixing analogue. Another thing I'd like to achieve is
                            to make DDJS more self-sustaining so it doesn't need to rely on members to provide the
                            essential gear needed for mixing. I mainly mix a variety of house, mostly focusing on
                            the micro/minimal sub genres, but I also love to stray into heavier techno and lighter
                            disco.</p>

                            <li>Computer Science</li>

                        <p>I learned to mix at DDJS in 2018, having been a fan of drum and bass for several
                            years, and have hugely enjoyed being a part of the community that it represents ever
                            since. I have plenty of ideas for this year, and hope to contribute some of my technical
                            skills in graphics, web design and broadcasting to help DDJS build a slick and professional
                            image that will gain it further recognition both online and at in-person events across
                            Durham. I think DDJS has huge potential to represent its members to the rest of the
                            local scene, and hope to be able to promote the culture of creative freedom and artistic
                            vision that I feel is currently lacking at many mainstream nights in Durham.</p>

                        <p>I've enjoyed meeting people in the society and the opportunities the society has provided
                            so far and wanted to be more involved. I have some experience with organising, playing and
                            attending events and parties, so went for social sec.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, I would like to
                            run some amazing events and nights with new and upcoming DJs in the society. Secondly,
                            encouraging people to listen and engage with different types of music they haven’t heard,
                            such as visiting record shops and having groups for discussing/recommending music they
                            like. Thirdly, socials to see well known and underground DJs play around the local area.</p>
